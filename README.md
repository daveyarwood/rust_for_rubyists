Rust is pretty cool. I'm terrible at low-level programming, but maybe getting into Rust will change that.

[Rust for Rubyists](http://www.rustforrubyists.com) was written some time ago, back when 0.11 was the current version, and [the author](http://www.steveklabnik.com) seems to be pretty busy working on Rust's official docs, so Rust for Rubyists is currently a bit outdated. I'm enjoying it, though, and I'm finding that figuring out how to update the examples to work with the current pre-1.0.0 nightly build is a fun challenge, and a great way to learn more about Rust in the process of digging through (what's currently available of) the official docs.

Here are the examples from Rust for Rubyists, updated to work with the nightly Rust 1.0.0ish that I'm using, with comments noting what I had to change to get them to work.

**EDIT 1/3/16:** It's been a while, and now Steve has finished [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book), which looks awesome and is described as "sort of a next-gen R4R". I might still update what I have here to Rust 1.5.0+ syntax, but then I'm definitely planning on reading Steve's new book instead.
